# workdayplanner

## Description

Create a work day planner that has text boxes every hour of the work day so you can stay on top of tasks. Today's date is visible at the top of the screen. If the timeblock is in the past it is grey, in the future it's green and in the present it's red. You are also able to hit save and save the information, so if you hit refresh it still is displayed.
